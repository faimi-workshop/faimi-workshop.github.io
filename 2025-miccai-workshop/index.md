## GISTeR Keynote
#### Advancing Fairness: Sex- and Gender-Aware AI for Equitable Neuroimaging
<p style="text-align: justify">Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly advanced neuroimaging research, offering unprecedented precision in diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical decision-making. However, the overwhelming focus on algorithmic accuracy has often overlooked critical dimensions of fairness, particularly those related to sex and gender differences in brain structure, function, and disease manifestation. This talk explores how sex- and gender-aware design can enhance equity in AI-driven neuroimaging research, offer strategies for inclusive data, model transparency, and suggest ways to integrate ethical, clinical, and population-specific considerations beyond technical performance.
In addition, we will discuss emerging evidences of sex-gender disparities in neuroimaging datasets and AI model outcomes, highlighting the risks of algorithmic bias that may exacerbate health inequities. Drawing from interdisciplinary research, the lecture introduces frameworks and best practices for embedding fairness and sex-gender specificity into the full neuroimaging AI pipeline—from data acquisition and annotation to model development, evaluation, and deployment. Special attention will be paid to inclusive data representation, transparent model reporting, and the need for regulatory and community engagement.
By re-centering fairness as a core design principle, we aim to build neuroimaging AI systems that are not only accurate, but also equitable, explainable, and truly beneficial to diverse populations. We redefine neuroimaging intelligence by integrating fairness, sex and gender awareness into every step of the AI pipeline.</p>

## FAIMI Horizon Award

The FAIMI Horizon Award aims to provide financial support and highlight one talented early-career researcher attending the conference for the first time, with a special focus on individuals from diverse and underserved backgrounds.

The award offers a full scholarship to attend the FAIMI Workshop, creating a valuable opportunity to present research, engage with the global community, and build lasting professional networks.

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Eligibility Criteria</b>:</p>

To be eligible for the FAIMI Horizon Award, the first author of the submitted paper must meet all of the following:

- The candidate must be a first-time attendee of the MICCAI conference.
- The candidate must be an early-career researcher, defined as a current student (undergraduate, master’s, PhD, or medical student), within two years of completing their terminal degree (i.e., MICCAI Young Scientists), or within four years of completing their terminal degree (i.e., Early-Career Scientists).
- The candidate should identify with one or more diverse or underserved backgrounds, such as being from an underrepresented gender or racial/ethnic group, having differing abilities, coming from a low- or lower-middle-income country, or residing in a country historically underrepresented at MICCAI. Candidates with other forms of social, cultural, or economic disadvantage are also encouraged to apply.

><b>Please note:</b> The MICCAI Registration and Travel Grants are intended to support in-person participation in the conference. If a selected grantee is unable to attend in person, the award will be offered to the next eligible candidate.

## Call for Papers
We invite the submission of papers for

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>FAIMI: The MICCAI 2025 Workshop on Fairness of AI in Medical Imaging</b>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Over the past several years, research on fairness, equity, and accountability in the context of machine learning has extensively demonstrated ethical risks in the deployment of machine learning systems in critical infrastructure, such as medical imaging.
The FAIMI workshop aims to encourage and emphasize research on and discussion of fairness of AI within the medical imaging domain.
We therefore invite the submission of papers, which will be selected for oral or poster presentation at the workshop. 
Topics include but are not limited to:</p>
- Assessment of bias in ML applications for medical imaging  
- Healthcare inequalities and/or the role of ML in addressing these  
- Discussion of definitions of fairness in medical contexts  
- Discussion of applicability of fairness in medical contexts  
- Bias mitigation strategies for ML/medical imaging  
- Ethics of fairness for medical imaging and medicine  
- Legal/regulatory considerations of fairness  
- Causality and fairness in medical imaging  
- The interplay of algorithmic and dataset bias 

<p style="text-align: justify">The workshop proceedings will be published in the MICCAI workshops volumes of the Springer Lecture Notes Computer Science (LNCS) series. 
Papers should be <i>anonymized</i> and at most 8 pages plus at most 2 extra pages of references using the <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">LNCS format</a>. 
The review process is conducted in a double-blind manner, following MICCAI standards. 
Submissions are made in <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/FAIMI2025">CMT</a>. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Following the <a href="https://conferences.miccai.org/2025/en/PAPER-SUBMISSION-GUIDELINES.html">MICCAI paper submission guidelines</a>, the submission of additional <b>supplementary material</b> is possible.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
 <b>NEW</b> Supplementary materials are limited to multimedia content (e.g., videos) as warranted by the technical application (e.g. robotics, surgery, ...). These files should not display any proofs, analysis, or additional results, and should not show any identification markers either. Violation of this guideline will lead to desk rejection. PDF files may not be submitted as supplementary materials in 2025 unless authors are citing a paper that has not yet been published. In such a case, authors are required to submit an anonymized version of the cited paper.
 </p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
All supplementary material must be self-contained and zipped into a single file. Only the following formats are allowed: avi, mp4, wmv. We encourage authors to submit videos using an MP4 codec such as DivX contained in an AVI. A README text file must be included with each video specifying the exact codec used and a URL where the codec can be downloaded.
 </p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
While the reviewers will have access to such supplementary material, <i>they are under no obligation to review it</i>, and the paper itself must contain all necessary information and illustrations for review purposes.
</p>
