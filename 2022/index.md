### TL;DR

 - Fairness+Medical Imaging based speakers, extended abstracts/posters, and discussion.
 - MICCAI 2022 Workshop (Sept. 17 or 26, Singapore)
 - Abstract Deadline TBD

Research in Fairness, Equity, and Accountability in ML has highlighted biases in learned systems between demographic groups, potentially adding risk to outcomes for specfic sub-populations. Recent work has uncovered these risks in both MIC and CAI application domains. Our tutorial aims to host a vibrant discussion of recent and ongoing work in Fairness/+ in Medical Imaging in a half-day tutorial at MICCAI 2022.

Alongside invited lectures, we also invite the submission of extended abstracts on the following topics:
 - Assessment of bias in ML applications for medical imaging
 - Healthcare inequalities and/or role of ML in addressing these
 - Discussion of definitions of fairness in medical contexts
 - Discussion of applicability of fairness in medical contexts
 - Bias mitigation strategies for ML/medical imaging
 - Ethics of ML in medical imaging and medicine
 - Legal/regulatory considerations of fairness
 - Causality and fairness in medical imaging
 - Interplay of algorithmic and dataset bias 

Ongoing or already published work are also welcome as abstracts.
