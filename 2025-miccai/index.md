## Call for Papers
We invite the submission of papers for

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>FAIMI: The MICCAI 2025 Workshop on Fairness of AI in Medical Imaging</b>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Over the past several years, research on fairness, equity, and accountability in the context of machine learning has extensively demonstrated ethical risks in the deployment of machine learning systems in critical infrastructure, such as medical imaging.
The FAIMI workshop aims to encourage and emphasize research on and discussion of fairness of AI within the medical imaging domain.
We therefore invite the submission of papers, which will be selected for oral or poster presentation at the workshop. 
Topics include but are not limited to:</p>
- Assessment of bias in ML applications for medical imaging  
- Healthcare inequalities and/or the role of ML in addressing these  
- Discussion of definitions of fairness in medical contexts  
- Discussion of applicability of fairness in medical contexts  
- Bias mitigation strategies for ML/medical imaging  
- Ethics of fairness for medical imaging and medicine  
- Legal/regulatory considerations of fairness  
- Causality and fairness in medical imaging  
- The interplay of algorithmic and dataset bias 

<p style="text-align: justify">The workshop proceedings will be published in the MICCAI workshops volumes of the Springer Lecture Notes Computer Science (LNCS) series. 
Papers should be <i>anonymized</i> and at most 8 pages plus at most 2 extra pages of references using the <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">LNCS format</a>. 
The review process is conducted in a double-blind manner, following MICCAI standards. 
Submissions are made in <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/FAIMI2025">CMT</a>. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Following the <a href="https://conferences.miccai.org/2025/en/PAPER-SUBMISSION-GUIDELINES.html">MICCAI paper submission guidelines</a>, the submission of additional <b>supplementary material</b> is possible.
This should be a separate file, and reviewers are under no obligation to review it; the paper must be self-contained and understandable without the supplementary material.
Note that in the submission system, supplementary materials can only be added once a regular submission has been created. (You can still edit your submission until the deadline.)
