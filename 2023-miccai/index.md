 - Organized jointly with the workshop on [Ethical and Philosophical Issues in Medical Imaging](https://sites.google.com/view/epimi)
 - Also see [our separate, free online event in autumn 2023](/2023-online/) and [last year's iteration of the same event](/2022/).
 - **Submission deadline extended by one week**


## Call for Papers
We invite the submission of papers for

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>FAIMI: The MICCAI 2023 Workshop on Fairness of AI in Medical Imaging</b>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Over the past several years, research on fairness, equity, and accountability in the context of machine learning has extensively demonstrated ethical risks in the deployment of machine learning systems in critical infrastructure, such as medical imaging.
The FAIMI workshop aims to encourage and emphasize research on and discussion of fairness of AI within the medical imaging domain.
We therefore invite the submission of papers, which will be selected for oral or poster presentation at the workshop. 
Topics include but are not limited to:</p>
- Case studies providing evidence of and/or addressing bias in medical imaging
- Algorithmic fairness in medical imaging
- Methods for measuring/evaluating bias in medical imaging
- Methods for mitigating bias in medical imaging
- Ethical aspects of bias and fairness in medical imaging
- Legal aspects of bias and fairness in medical imaging
- Policy in the context of bias and fairness in medical imaging

<p style="text-align: justify">The workshop proceedings will be published in the MICCAI workshops volumes of the Springer Lecture Notes Computer Science (LNCS) series. 
Selected papers will also be invited to present at <a href="/2023-online/">the virtual FAIMI workshop tentatively scheduled for November 6th</a>.
Papers should be <i>anonymized</i> and at most 8 pages plus at most 2 extra pages of references using the <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">LNCS format</a>. 
The review process is conducted in a double-blind manner, following MICCAI standards. 
Submissions are made in <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/FAIMI2023">CMT</a>. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Following the <a href="https://conferences.miccai.org/2023/en/PAPER-SUBMISSION-AND-REBUTTAL-GUIDELINES.html">MICCAI paper submission guidelines</a>, the submission of additional <b>supplementary material</b> is possible.
This should be a separate file, and reviewers are under no obligation to review it; the paper must be self-contained and understandable without the supplementary material.
Note that in the submission system, supplementary materials can only be added once a regular submission has been created. (You can still edit your submission until the deadline.)

		<b>Dr. Judy Gichoya</b> is an assistant professor at Emory university in Interventional Radiology and Informatics. 
		Her career focus is on validating machine learning models for health in real clinical settings, exploring explainability, fairness, and a specific focus on how algorithms fail. 
		She is heavily invested in training the next generation of data scientists through multiple high school programs, serving as the program director for radiology: AI trainee editorial board and the medical students machine learning elective.
