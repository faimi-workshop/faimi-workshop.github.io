As this is a fairly minimalistic and static web page, there should not be many concerns relating to our data handling. We hope our privacy notice below covers everything you need to know, but if you still have any questions please feel free to contact any of us.

### Who we are
"Fairness of AI in Medical Imaging (FAIMI)" is an independent academic initiative. 
The organizers are listed on the front page and can be reached at <a href="mailto:faimi-organizers@googlegroups.com">faimi-organizers@googlegroups.com</a>.
This website has been created and is maintained by the project team.

### What information we collect and how we use it
#### If you subscribe to our [newsletter](/newsletter)
We will add your name and email address to our newsletter mailing list, which is managed by [Brevo](www.brevo.com). 
We do not use any tracking in our newsletters, which means that we can’t identify how many or which users have opened mailouts or followed links.
Subscribers receive information regarding events in our workshop series and other related activities, at most once per month.
We will never share your data with anyone beyond our team and our mail service provider, [Brevo](www.brevo.com).
Brevo stores all data on servers within the EU (see [Brevo's data storage locations](https://help.brevo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001005510-Data-storage-location)) and in compliance with the GDPR (see [Brevo's privacy policy](https://www.brevo.com/legal/privacypolicy/)).

#### If you contact us via email
Your email address and message will be accessible to our small team of support staff and may be forwarded to the person or people in the organization best equipped to respond. We adhere to strict internal privacy policies which comply with the GDPR.
If you send an email to <a href="mailto:faimi-organizers@googlegroups.com">faimi-organizers@googlegroups.com</a>, your data will be stored on Google's servers and be subject to [Google's privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
Your personal information is never shared externally by us, or used for purposes other than the above.

### Legal basis for processing
In subscribing to the newsletter or contacting us, you are consenting to the processes as described on this page. The legal basis is GDPR  6(1)(a) – Consent of the data subject.

### Retention periods
In all cases listed above, we retain your personal data until such a time as you unsubscribe or ask us to remove your details.

If you contact us via email, we reserve the right to keep your message indefinitely. This is to aid continuity and so that we can view any historic context which may have bearing on subsequent support mail, even if members of the support staff change. Support staff adhere to strict internal privacy and security policies.

### How to unsubscribe from the newsletter
Every newsletter contains a quick and easy unsubscribe link in its footer. Alternatively, you can also contact any of our team members to remove your data from all of our systems.

### Your right to access
You may contact us at any time to ask to see what personal data we hold about you. Please contact us to request this.

### Your right to erasure
You may request that we destroy the personal data that we hold about you, provided that there is no legitimate reason for us continuing to hold it, that is to say if it does not relate to financial transactions or is unlikely to be of any legal or practical purpose in the future. Please contact us to request this.

### Your right to complain
If you believe that we have mishandled your data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Danish Data Protection Agency, Datatilsynet. (But please do contact us first, so that we can try and help).

### Data, cookies, and external services
